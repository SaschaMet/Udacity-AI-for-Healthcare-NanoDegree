# Expected results

Please put the artefacts from Section 2 here:  
  
* Functional code that trains the segmentation model
* Test report with Dice scores on test set (can be a json file). Your final average Dice with the default model should be around .90
* Screenshots from your Tensorboard (or other visualization engine) output, showing Train and Validation loss plots, along with images of the predictions that your model is making at different stages of training
* Your trained model PyTorch parameter file (`model.pth`)
