    "## Code Description\n",
    "1. You can run the code by executing the cell with the Evaluate() function to start the Pulse Rate Algorithm.\n",
    "2. The Evaluate function gets the Troika dataset and then calls the RunPulseRateAlgorithm function. \n",
    "3. The RunPulseRateAlgorithm function itself expects two files as input:\n",
    "\t* data_fl: file containing ppg and acc data \n",
    "\t* ref_fl: file containing ground truth heart rates\n",
    "4. The RunPulseRateAlgorithm function then predicts the heart rate, computes confidence estimates for the 8 second time windows of the ppg and acc data and calculates the error between the heart estimates and the ground truth\n",
    "5. The function Evaluate() will, after the RunPulseRateAlgorithm function has finished, calculate an overall mean absolute error at 90% availability\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Description\n",
    "* A subset of TROIKA dataset was used \n",
    "* The were 12 subjects in the dataset ranged from age 18 to 35\n",
    "* During data recording, each subject ran on a treadmill with changing speeds\n",
    "* The dataset consist of signals from accelerometer and ppg sensors\n",
    "* Both signals were recored with two pulse oximeters (green LEDs, wavelength 515nm, distance from center 2 cm)\n",
    "* The accelerometer was a three-axis Accelerometer\n",
    "* The pulse oximeter and the accelerometer were both embedded in a wristband \n",
    "* All signals were sampled at 125 Hz\n",
    "* For a more accurate algorithm it would be benefitial to have more data, f.e. more participants from different age groups which would perform different activities\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm Description and Performance\n",
    "The ppg data which the algorithm uses for its predictions is collected by a sensor which measures the blood in the ventricles. Light emitted by an LED on this sensor is reflected less when the ventricles contract and more blood is present. The photodetector of the sensor will see a drop in reflected light. When the blood returns to the heart and fewer red blood cells are present, the detector will see an increase in reflected light.\n",
    "Acitivies performed by the subject (e.g. any arm movements) will also effect the blood levels so the ppg sensor can detect this, too. \n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm looks for the strongest frequency of the ppg and the acc signals to determine which frequency to pick as the heart rate. To do that, the algorithm follows these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The data first is piped through a bandpass filter to remov signals outside of 40-240 bpm\n",
    "* Then for each 8 second window:<br/>\n",
    "\t- aggregated the acc into one magnitude signal<br/>\n",
    "\t- transform the signals with a Fourier transformation <br/>\n",
    "\t- find the peaks with the largest magnitudes and select that signal as the heart rate<br/>\n",
    "\t- return the bpm prediction and a confidence value\n",
    "\n",
    "A high confidence value means that the meassured signal at that location is strong (it has little noise). A low confidence value means that the signal has a low signal to noise ratio. But neither a high nor a low confidence value means that the algorithm performs better or worse. It is just the measurment of the signal to noise ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm can be affected f.e. by noise from other factors like arm position or movement. It also may not perform well when there is a sudden change in heartbeats.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "* The performance is calculated using the mean absolute error between the estimations and the ground truth signal. \n",
    "* The ground trouth was obtained by an ECG\n",
    "* The calculated performance for this training dataset at 90% availability was a MAE of 24.935 BPM.\n",
    "* This algorithm assumes that the data comming from the accelerometer sensors result from running on a treadmill. This is not the case for other activities like f.e. swimming, so the error of this algorithm can be higher when used on other datasets with other acitivies"
